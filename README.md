# official-forecast-vintages

Extract and compare different vintages of economic forecasts from official sources (OBR, CBO, etc.).

A "vintage" refers to a specific release of a forecast - for example, the OBR's March 2025 Economic and Fiscal Outlook vs their November 2025 update. Comparing vintages helps track how official projections evolve over time.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .

# Get a series
cpi_series = nov.get_series("cpi", years=[2025, 2026, 2027])

# Compare two forecasts
march = OBRForecast("march-2025")
comparison_df = nov.compare_to(march, metric="cpi")
```
